# Veil of the Forgotten

## Description
"Veil of the Forgotten" presents a quest to assist a vampire with the capture of living souls, or to defeat her for good.

## Features
- **Chrono Globe**: The player may obtain orbs to capture NPCs(and creatures) indefinitly. Once released, the NPCs will appear as they were on capture. 
- The orb may be placed on its stand. From there, the NPC may be displayed above it, at small scale.
- Released actors/creatures can be controlled. If you release them from your spell, they will return to their original position.
- Actor health is restored to full on initial capture. Inventory sharing is enabled.

## Quest Stages
1. **Vampire Vision**: The player has a vision in their dream of a cave, containing a glass mine, and a hidden daedric ruin.
2. **Pact with Moriana**: Moriana greets the player, saying she has been waiting for my arrival. The player may from this point on, kill her, though it will be difficult. This is the "good" ending.
3. **Hunting the Marked**: The player is informed of the person living in Akamora, Darvon Golaren. He is unremarkable now, but the player is asked to observe the crystal ball nearby.
- Viewing the ball shows the player a vision of Darvon gaining power through training, and fighting Moriana, striking her down, 300 years in the future, in the ruins of vivec.
4. **Erasing from Existence**: Witness the erasure of individuals' existence, causing the world to forget them and reassign their roles.
5. **Consequences Unfold**: Deal with the immediate and unexpected changes in the world resulting from your actions.
6. **Final Eclipse**: Decide whether to support Morianaâ€™s dominion or use the orbs against her, potentially resetting the fates of those captured.

Greetings, young one. I have waiting for your arrival for a long time. I require your help. I hold the power of the Veil of the Forgotten, which can be used through the Chrono Globes I've created. 

If you'd like, you may ask me about my plans, or we can go straight into what needs to happen.
